description: Inveigh's SMB relay function. This module can be used to relay incoming HTTP/Proxy NTLMv1/NTLMv2 authentication
  requests to an SMB target. If the authentication is successfully relayed and the account has the correct privilege, a specified
  command or Empire launcher will be executed on the target PSExec style. This module works best while also running collection/inveigh
  with HTTP disabled. Note that this module exposes only a subset of Inveigh Relay's parameters. Inveigh Relay can be used
  through Empire's scriptimport and scriptcmd if additional parameters are needed.
