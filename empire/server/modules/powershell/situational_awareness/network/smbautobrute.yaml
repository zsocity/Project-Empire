description: Runs an SMB brute against a list of usernames/passwords. Will check the DCs to interrogate the bad password count
  of the users and will keep bruting until either a valid credential is discoverd or the bad password count reaches one below
  the threshold. Run "shell net accounts" on a valid agent to determine the lockout threshold. VERY noisy! Generates a ton
  of traffic on the DCs.
